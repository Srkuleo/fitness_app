This is still work in progress, updating everyday (I try to), aiming to go in production in late summer 2023. Application is dedicated to **tracking**,
**updating**, **checking**, **editing** and **storing** your workout sessions, something like personalized, easy to maneuver in notebook. Aimed to make
