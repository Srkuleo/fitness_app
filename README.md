# Archived

Worked on this one for a while but got really interesed in RSC and App Router, tried to migrate incrementally but at that time, since project was originally started with T3 stack, it got really buggy. So I decided to start from scratch keeping some core ideas intact while implementing new ones regarding both UI and logic. Everything made up until archiving is now in [noteset repo](https://github.com/srkuleo/noteset), adjusted to the needs of RSC and server actions.
