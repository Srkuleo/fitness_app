# NoteSet - personalized fitness app

This is still work in progress, updating everyday (I try to), aiming to go in production in late summer 2023. Application is dedicated to **tracking**,
**updating**, **checking**, **editing** and **storing** your workout sessions, something like personalized, easy to maneuver in notebook. Aimed to make
tracking your fitness progress easy.

Stay tuned for future updates!

## Future updates and plans:

#### Priority

- _Refactor edit form, whole editing system (3 separate buttons one for deleting, one for editing and one for adding workout, figure out position for them) and then try to add modals for deleting workouts, submiting or discarding editing form._

- _Make start button a link component that leads to new page with workout details._
- _Work around setting planetscale db and prisma schema._
- _Push newly added workouts from state to db._
- _Add an active workout page, with proper structure based on database model._
- _Set a limit on description input field to no longer than 85ch._

#### Later on

- _Add profile page with certain type of tracking achievements._
