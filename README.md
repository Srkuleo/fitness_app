# NoteSet - personalized fitness app

This is an early stage of development for personalized fitness tracker.
It should be able to track, store and access workouts previously done for better exercising experience.

Stay tuned for future updates!

## Future updates and plans:

- _Add blur or gradient effect over bg image on signed in page._
- _Add dropdown menu with option to edit, view logs and sign out (potentially dark mode and user profile) and list menu with choosable workouts._
- _Polish signed in page._
- _Fix prop drilling in index.tsx and sign-up.tsx using Zustand._
- _Add responsiveness to the UI._
