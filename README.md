# Archived

Worked on this one for a while but got really interesed in RSC and App Router so I didn't want to migrate. Really wanted a clean start so I made a noteset_ repository with an intent to publish every change to my app there. Everything made up until archiving is now in there adjused to needs of RSC and server actions.
